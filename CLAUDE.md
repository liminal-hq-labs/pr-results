# CLAUDE.md

A summary of [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), which is canonical. Keep the two in sync.

## What this is

{{PROJECT_TITLE}} is a Liminal HQ Labs experiment: {{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}. Experimental, so anything may change. Behaviour lives in `SPEC.md`, decisions in `docs/decisions.md`.

## Rules to remember

- **Canadian English.** Real em dashes. Sentence case. No hard-wrapped markdown prose. Ship the result, not the journey: no "this PR" or reviewer names in code or docs.
- **Conventional Commits.** Body in markdown with bold labels and no headings, hard-wrapped, written to a file and committed with `git commit -F`. End with a `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
- **Git.** Topic branches, merge commits only, branches deleted on merge. Never push, tag, publish or dispatch workflows unless asked. Never `git add -A` or `git commit -a`. `PLAN.md` stays out of git.
- **Formatting.** Tabs everywhere except YAML. Rust uses rustfmt with hard tabs (`rustfmt.toml`).
- **Headers.** SPDX header on every source, script, YAML, TOML and SVG file: summary line, blank, "(c) Copyright 2026 Liminal HQ, Scott Morris", `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 OR MIT`.
- **CI.** One job per check. Shared images come from `liminal-hq/.github`. Dependabot is off unless the project opts in.
- **Docs.** Update `SPEC.md` and `docs/decisions.md` in the same change as the behaviour.
